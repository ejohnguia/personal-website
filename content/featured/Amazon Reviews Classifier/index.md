We utilized the [Amazon Review Data (2018) dataset](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html) and employed [PySpark](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/pyspark) on the [Databricks Community edition](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/) to develop a Machine Learning model that predicts the favorability of product reviews.
